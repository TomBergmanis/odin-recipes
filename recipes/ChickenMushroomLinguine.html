    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package dried linguine pasta</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>6 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and
        cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion
        and mushrooms and cook until tender. Remove from the skillet with a
        slotted spoon and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken pieces to the pan and sprinkle with garlic. Cook and stir
        until evenly browned and cooked through. Whisk flour and salt into the
        pan drippings until smooth. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and simmer
        over low heat until slightly thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return mushrooms and garlic to the pan and stir in sour cream; season
        with pepper. Cook until heated through, but do not boil. Serve over
        linguine.
      </li>
    </ol>
